## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an Active Directory environment integrated with Splunk for comprehensive event monitoring and analysis. By simulating a brute force attack using Kali Linux and conducting additional testing with Atomic Red Team, the project aims to provide hands-on experience in setting up and managing IT infrastructure, detecting potential threats, and analyzing system events. This initiative is intended to enhance skills in IT administration, event telemetry, threat detection, and response, equipping participants with practical knowledge for real-world cybersecurity challenges.

The diagram illustrates the network setup for our project:

- Windows Server: This server will run Active Directory.
- Windows 10 Machine: This will be the target machine for the Active Directory.
- Kali Linux Machine: This machine will be used to perform brute force attacks and other security testing.
- Splunk Server: This will be running on an Ubuntu server to collect and analyze logs and events from the Windows Server and Windows 10 machine.
- Network Infrastructure: Includes a router and a switch to connect all devices to the Internet and each other.
